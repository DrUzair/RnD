Study the impact of smartphone usage on cognitive performance in short-term ongoing tasks and long-term consequences.
# Cognition Factors:
## Attention
Ability to focus on single source of information (input) and sustaind that focus. 
Attention can be divided or distracted by technology gadgets in two ways.
A disruption or distraction to attention can be exogenous (outside phone) or indogenous (within phone).
### Attentional Functions
1. Context Switching
2. Filtering distractions
..* Context Switching Cost
## Memory
The ability to commiting facts to long-term memory for later usage is dependent on knowing whether the information will be stored by computer or not. Dubbed as **[digital amnesia](amnesia.kaspersky.com/)** or **[Google effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755/)**
The symbiotic nature of relationship between technology and its users has morphed the memory into *where to find a fact*  instead of *what is a fact*. 
## Gratification Delay
## Analytical Abilities
Ready and fingertip access to search engines cause decline in cognitive abilities [Brain in Pocket](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215001272)
# Attention and Technology Usage
## Attentional Deficit
Deleterious effect of a distraction on **scope of attenion**
## Media Multitasking
Simultaneous use of more than one media technologies. Media Multitasking Index (MMI) assesses an individuals media-multitasking habits.
