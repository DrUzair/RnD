Smartphones and Cognition: A Review of Research Exploring the Links between Mobile Technology Habits and Cognitive Functioning
Henry H. Wilmer, Lauren E. Sherman, and Jason M. Chein

Study the impact of smartphone usage on cognitive performance in short-term ongoing tasks and long-term consequences.
# Cognition Factors:<a name="CognitionFactors"></a>
## Attention
<a name="Attention"></a>
The ability to focus on single source of information (input) and sustaind that focus. 
Attention can be divided or distracted by technology gadgets in two ways.
A disruption or distraction to attention can be exogenous (outside phone) or indogenous (within phone).
### Attentional Functions
<a name="AttentionFuncs"></a>
1. Context Switching
2. Filtering distractions
..* Context Switching Cost
## Memory <a name="Memory"></a>
Smartphones and internet have caused *offloading* of memory function making the user less able to learn and retain the knowledge.
The ability to commiting facts to long-term memory for later usage is dependent on knowing whether the information will be stored by computer or not. Dubbed as **[digital amnesia](amnesia.kaspersky.com/)** or **[Google effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21764755/)**
The symbiotic nature of relationship between technology and its users has morphed the memory into *where to find a fact*  instead of *what is a fact*. 
Even the [point and shoot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24311477) culture of taking pictures affect the memory of an event. 
## Gratification Delay
Reward processing capability of brain is another subject of investigation as a dependent variable of digital media technology.
[First time smartphone usage](https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1935861X15004568/1-s2.0-S1935861X15004568-main.pdf?_tid=8eb0fe58-0b7e-11e8-96b4-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1517950062_4fde0f5e88fd29618210e7dafec459e4) is experimentally proven to have detrimental effects on the ability to let short-term rewards go for long-term substantial benifits.
## Analytical Abilities
Ready and fingertip access to search engines decline or even supplant the cognitive abilities [Brain in Pocket](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215001272)

# Attention and Technology Usage
## Attentional Deficit
Deleterious effect of a distraction on **scope of attenion**
## Media Multitasking
Simultaneous use of more than one media technologies. Media Multitasking Index (MMI) assesses an individuals media-multitasking habits.
