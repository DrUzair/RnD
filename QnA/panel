Questions to be addressed:

Is it all machine learning, AI, and coding?

   The ML/AI and
coding are means to an end which is solving a business/research/policy problem.
The business component of the mix is more important.

   

Does the data have to be big?  and what is "big data" anyway?

   Big data does
provide a promise for having a larger, more connected and coherent picture of
reality. However, just the size doesn't matter without meaning. 

   Meaningful data
[that carries enough information about phenomena/process/reality] is more
important.

   

What background is most suitable for data
science?

   Individuals can
enter into this field from a variety of different angles.

   Data Scientist job
requires a robust skill set touching Statistics, Mathematics [Core AI and ML],
Computer Science [Applied].

   Other background
would need to invest time and effort to build up the basic knowledge base in
above mentioned. 

   

What is the need for statisticians?   mathematicians?  operations research specialists?  

How essential are skills in SAS, SQL, matlab,
python, and r ?

  Tools to implement,
productize and maintain solutions are not less important than theoritcal
understanding of how machine learning algorithms

  are derived,
extended and specialized.

  Without a 

What are the new “must have” skills?Is a graduate degree a must?

  Yes. But not
sufficient. Build an online portfolio of projects 

Are data science bootcamps replacing graduate
degrees to get people into the field quickly?

  A graduate degree in
Mathematics, Statistics, Computing is necessary prerequisite without which
topics in data science would not be understandable.

  Therefore, bootcamps
and certificate programs can brush up and tune the knowledge-base in addition
to providing an introductory experience into 

  the tools but they
cannot replace.


How is data science different than data
mining?  business intelligence?  analytics?It is at the intersection of multiple disciplines. Data Analysis: A human process of finding hidden patterns and strAnalytics: Automating the analysis process How does/should data science fit into an
organization?

because it is responsible for managing and monitoring workloads, maintaining a

high availability features of Hadoop.  https://medium.com/@markobonaci/the-history-of-hadoop-68984a11704
