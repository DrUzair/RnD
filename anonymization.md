# Data Anonymization
Data anonymization, also known as psudeonymization, refers to a family of techniques that make it impossible or impractical to identify a data subject.
Compliance to General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**) has increased the importance of data anonymization. GPPR relaxes it stringent requirements if effective measures are taken to de-identify the people in data such that data controllers and processors can collect, process, transfer and monetize their data.
