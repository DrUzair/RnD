# Data Anonymization
Data anonymization, also known as psudeonymization, refers to a family of techniques that make it impossible or impractical to identify a data subject.
Compliance to General Data Protection Regulation (**GDPR**) has increased the importance of data anonymization. GPPR relaxes it stringent requirements if effective measures are taken to de-identify the people in data such that data controllers and processors can collect, process, transfer and monetize their data.

The data based enterprises, both controllers and processors, who opt to choose data anonymization are not completely safe from stepping across regulatory bounds.
