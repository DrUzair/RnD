Machine Learning is domain dependent and trial-and-error descipline.
Domain-dependency: Solutions/Techniques/Insights that work for one domain (NLP) may not hold useful in other domain (Image/Video Processing)
Trial-and-Error: Every different problem need to pass through numerous iterations to find out best values for hyperparameters (learning-rate, neural network architechture, activation functions etc)
